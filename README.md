A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started
# The Healer Project - BU
It has been recognized that the online tutorials for fixing up different issues are not always helpful since sometimes the real problem can get more complicated and the steps are not going smooth and easy as those in the tutorial and you might get stuck and never know what do. Hence make it worse instead of fixing it. Therefore, the proposed project aims to tackle this issue by offering you an online platform ( Flutter application ) that enable you to explain your problem even by a photo or a video , determine the domain , and language and simply you will be connected to a bunch of The Healers (people who will help you) and you are free to choose the right Healer for you and he will help you to fix the problem step by step. You can choose a healer that can help you Online or locally by determining your location using the GPS. You can also register as a Healer and help others.
